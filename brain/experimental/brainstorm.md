# Memory Structure and Experience Tracking Brainstorm

## Core Concepts

### 1. Memory Node Structure
- Each experience/memory as a node
- Properties:
  - Timestamp
  - Type (activity, conversation, emotion, preference)
  - Content
  - Importance weight
  - Emotional impact score
  - Related concepts/tags

### 2. Memory Trees and Relations
- Hierarchical Organization:
  ```
  Activities
  ├── Music
  │   ├── Listened Songs
  │   ├── Favorite Genres
  │   └── Music Moods
  ├── Hobbies
  └── Daily Routines
  ```

### 3. Experience Tracking
- Recent activities log
- Frequency tracking of repeated activities
- Preference strength based on repetition
- Emotional associations with activities

### 4. Self-Reflection Mechanism
- Periodic analysis of recent experiences
- Pattern recognition in activities
- Preference evolution tracking
- Memory consolidation process

## Implementation Ideas

### Memory Storage Structure
```python
class MemoryNode:
    id: str
    timestamp: datetime
    type: str  # "activity", "preference", "emotion"
    content: dict
    tags: List[str]
    connections: List[str]  # IDs of related nodes
    importance: float
    emotional_impact: float
```

### Key Features to Implement
1. **Dynamic Memory Graphs**
   - Nodes connected by relationship types
   - Weighted connections based on relevance
   - Temporal relationships

2. **Activity Tracking**
   - Log of recent activities
   - Frequency counters
   - Preference strength calculation
   - Context preservation

3. **Self-Reflection Process**
   - Regular memory consolidation
   - Pattern identification
   - Preference updates
   - Memory pruning/strengthening

4. **Query Capabilities**
   - Recent activity summaries
   - Preference lookups
   - Related memory chains
   - Temporal queries

## Example Scenarios

### Music Preference Tracking
```
Recent Song -> Genre Association -> Emotional Response -> Preference Update
```

### Activity Pattern Recognition
```
Multiple Gaming Sessions -> Gaming Preference -> Schedule Pattern -> Personality Trait
```

## Next Steps
1. Design core memory node structure
2. Implement basic memory graph
3. Create activity logging system
4. Develop self-reflection scheduler
5. Build query interface for memory access

## Questions to Address
- How to balance short-term vs long-term memories?
- What triggers memory consolidation?
- How to handle conflicting preferences?
- When to prune or archive old memories?
- How to maintain memory consistency?
